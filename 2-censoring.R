## Program: 2. Censoring
##
## Purpose: Identify the date for the following censoring events in the as-treated analysis:
## 1. Patients are censored when there is a 30+ day gap (or otherwise defined grace period) in the treatment class that led to cohort entry.
## 2. Patients are censored at the date they switch to another treatment for the same indication (identified in previous program).

## ---------------------------
##
## Notes: The grace period defines the number of days for what is considered a gap in treatment supply
## and can be adapted to be more or less conservative.
##
## Algorithm used to define treatment duration was developed by Pauline Reynier at the Lady Davis Institute.
