Observational data is increasingly used for health research and can be analyzed through an intention-to-treat (ITT) or an as-treated (AT) approach. While the ITT approach estimates the effect of starting treatment, the AT approach estimates the effect of starting and adhering to treatment at the cost of additional vulnerability to selection bias introduced by informative censoring. Methods to deal with informative censoring are well-established, but their application in observational studies remains scarce, in large part due to their complexity. This work aims to fill this gap by providing a transparent comparison of ITT and AT analyses with adjustment for informative censoring using a large and high-quality data source. To do so, all-cause mortality among first-time antidepressant users in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was compared using ITT and AT analyses, incorporating inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). Four models to define censoring weights were compared to adjust for censoring at different times throughout the study. The results showed that ITT and AT estimates diverged in one treatment group, but not in another, primarily due to differential censoring by age. The IPCW weights reduced the influence of this differential censoring, demonstrating their potential utility in as-treated analyses.
